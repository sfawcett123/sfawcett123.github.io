## Space
To overcome my limited space issue, I have already decided to make a fighter, and I will only focus on the front cockpit. By limiting the space, I use to about 6-foot by 3-foot I had the idea of using an old single bedframe on castors as a base. I can then push my cockpit out of the way when not needed.

## Realism
I do not believe my budget or skills will run to making a cockpit that is 100% identical to the real thing.  The main goal is to get something up and running and develop it from there.

## Research
Researching on the internet I have found this chap [Warthog](https://thewarthogproject.com/) to have perfected some of the ideas I have had. I will be using some of his concepts.
