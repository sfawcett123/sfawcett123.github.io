## Home Flight Simulator

I have been a fan of Flight Simulators ever since I was an Engineer in the Royal Air Force fixing them. I used to work on my favorite plane the
[Phantom F4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_Phantom_in_UK_service) and I have wanted a home cockpit for sometime now.

I have a few restrictictions:
- Space
- Budget
- Energy ( Complex )

but I have a few skills:
- ex-RAF
- Trained in Electronics
- Software Engineer

## Research

Researching on the internet I have found this chap [Warthog](https://thewarthogproject.com/) to have perfected some of the ideas I have had. So I will be using some of his concepts.
