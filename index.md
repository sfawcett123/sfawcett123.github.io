## Home Flight Simulator

I have been a fan of Flight Simulators ever since I was an Engineer in the Royal Air Force fixing them. I used to work on my favourite plane the
[Phantom F4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_Phantom_in_UK_service) and I have wanted a home cockpit for some time now.

## Limitations

### Space
To overcome my limited space issue, I have already decided to make a fighter, and I will only focus on the front cockpit. By limiting the space, I use to about 6-foot by 3-foot I had the idea of using an old single bedframe on castors as a base. I can then push my cockpit out of the way when not needed.

### Realism
I do not believe my budget or skills will run to making a cockpit that is 100% identical to the real thing.  The main goal is to get something up and running and develop it from there.

## Research
Researching on the internet I have found this chap [Warthog](https://thewarthogproject.com/) to have perfected some of the ideas I have had. I will be using some of his concepts.
