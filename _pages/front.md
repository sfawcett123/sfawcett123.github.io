# Home Flight Simulator

I have been a fan of Flight Simulators ever since I was an Engineer in the Royal Air Force fixing them. I used to work on my favourite plane the
[Phantom F4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_Phantom_in_UK_service) and I have wanted a home cockpit for some time now.
