## Space
The main problem I have is space. I need to move my cockpit out of the way when the wife wants the space. So, to solve this problem I have found an
old steel single bed frame, put castors on it and now I can move it.
This does now limit me to building a single seater cockpit. but, thats OK. It has helped me focus my design.

## Seating
Since I am based on a single seater, I have two choices.

1. Use designs found on the internet to build an enjector seat.
2. Use an old gaming chair.

I went with using a gaming chair, removing the swivel base and mounting it using steel supports to my bedframe. This allows me to get started, and is fairly future proof as I can remove it and replace it later.

## Dimensions
Worrking with some initial Dimensions from this page https://forum.dcs.world/topic/314581-cockpit-dimensions-from-a-real-f-4-phantom/
